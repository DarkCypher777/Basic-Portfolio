        <p>Hi there and welcome to my website. So to start off my name is Benjamin Diamond but you can just call me Ben,
        many of my favorite actives is playing video games, broswing the internet, and recently got into Warhammer 40k (dont get into it, once you start you can't stop its a nightmare).
        So what else about me, oh yea im taking this coding course so this website might look awesome (or just horrible) and hopefully be pleasing to you.
        <br>
        <p>Feel free to explore around and tell me if there is anything wrong.
